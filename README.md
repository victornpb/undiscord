## Disclaimer

**DO NOT SHARE YOUR AUTHORIZATION TOKEN!**

Sharing your authorization token on the internet will give full access to your Discord account! [There are bots gathering credentials all over the internet](https://github.com/rndinfosecguy/Scavenger).
If you post your token by accident, log out from Discord on the **same browser** where you got the token immediately.
Changing your password will make sure that you get logged out of every device. It is advised that you turn on [2FA](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication) afterwards.

If you are unsure, do not share screenshots or logs on the internet.
