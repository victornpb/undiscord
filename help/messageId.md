# messageId
You can delete all messages after a specific message, before a specific message, or everything between two points. For that, you need to provide a messageID:
- Right-click a message, and click [Copy ID](./developerMode.md)
> If the `Copy ID` doesn't show up, you need to enable [Developer mode](./developerMode.md) first.
