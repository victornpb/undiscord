# Search and Delete Delay

This setting controls the initial delay for searching messages. Sometimes the Discord API will quickly rate limit you, in this case setting the delays to something higher might help. This is especially true for the **Delete Delay**.

From testing a delete delay of 2000 ms is sometimes possible without being rate limited. By default it is set to 2500 ms as this will almost never result in rate limiting.
