# Search, Delete and Retry Delay

This setting controls the initial delay for for searching messages. Sometimes the Discord API will quickly rate limit you, in this case setting the delays to something higher might help. This is especially true for the **Delete Delay**.


The retry delay is a value that delays how long the script should wait before trying to delete the same message again if there was an error trying to delete it.
