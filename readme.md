#### About running code on your console

I don't recommend running code from random places you get on the internet. For that same reason, I deliberately choose to make it readable (that's why it is a bit lenthy). That way people can analyze it and understand what does it does before running it, and be sure that nothing sketchy is happening under the hood.

# DO NOT SHARE YOUR `authToken`!

Sharing your authToken on the internet will give full access to your account! [There are bots gathering credentials all over the internet](https://github.com/rndinfosecguy/Scavenger).
If you post your token by accident, LOGOUT from discord on that **same browser** you got that token imediately.
Changing your password will make sure that you get logged out of every device. I advice that you turn on [2FA](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication) afterwards.

If you are unsure do not share screenshots, or copy paste logs on the internet.
