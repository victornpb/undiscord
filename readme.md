# Undiscord - Delete all messages in a Discord channel or DM
## I did not make this tool, I have simply fixed some of the code so it works for later versions of discord. Find the original version of this project [here](https://github.com/victornpb/undiscord). Make sure to star their project!

## ‚õîÔ∏è DO NOT SHARE YOUR AUTH TOKEN! ‚õîÔ∏è ##

Sharing your authToken on the internet will give full access to your account! [There are bots gathering credentials all over the internet](https://github.com/rndinfosecguy/Scavenger).
If you post your token by accident, LOGOUT from discord on that **same browser** you got that token imediately.
Changing your password will make sure that you get logged out of every device. I advice that you turn on [2FA](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication) afterwards.

If you are unsure do not post screenshots, or logs on the internet.

## Security Concerns

Using third-party scripts means you trust that the script‚Äôs developer hasn‚Äôt inserted malicious functionality into the code and has secured it against attackers trying to do the same. You should never run code you don't trust.

Please read: [what I'm doing to ensure this is safe for users][security_policy].
