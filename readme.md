> Use at your own risk! ([discussion](https://github.com/victornpb/undiscord/discussions/273)).

1. First you need a Browser Extension for managing UserScripts[[1]][userscrips_faq] (skip if you already have one):  
   * Chrome: [Violentmonkey][chrome_violentmonkey] or [Tampermonkey][chrome_tampermonkey]
   * Firefox: [Greasemonkey][firefox_greasemonkey], [Tampermonkey][firefox_tampermonkey], or [Violentmonkey][firefox_violentmonkey]  
   * Opera: [Tampermonkey][opera_tampermonkey] or [Violentmonkey][opera_violentmonkey]
   * Brave: [Violentmonkey][chrome_violentmonkey] or [Tampermonkey][chrome_tampermonkey]
   * Edge: [Tampermonkey][edge_tampermonkey]  
   * Safari: ~[Tampermonkey][safari_tampermonkey]~ 
    
1. Install Undiscord:  
  [![][greasyfork_icon]][greasyfork_url] or [![][openuserjs_icon]][openuserjs_url](outdated)

1. Open <a href="https://discord.com/channels/@me" target="_blank">Discord</a> in your __browser__ (Not the App) and go to the channel or direct message you would like to be wiped.

1. Click the <kbd>🗑️</kbd> button that was added in the top right corner.

1. Click on the <kbd>get</kbd> buttons near **Authorization**, **Author** and **Guild/Channel**.  

1. Click the <kbd>Start</kbd> button to begin wipping!

I made this tool just for you ❤️ , it would be awesome if you could just click the [⭐️ Star button](https://github.com/victornpb/undiscord) at the top!

> A few extra generous people asked for this, so here you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vitim). Thank you! You'll be in my special list ^_^

## ⛔️ DO NOT SHARE YOUR AUTH TOKEN! ⛔️ ##

Sharing your authToken on the internet will give full access to your account! [There are bots gathering credentials all over the internet](https://github.com/rndinfosecguy/Scavenger).
If you post your token by accident, LOGOUT from discord on that **same browser** you got that token imediately.
Changing your password will make sure that you get logged out of every device. I advice that you turn on [2FA](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication) afterwards.

If you are unsure do not post screenshots, or logs on the internet.

## Security Concerns

Using third-party scripts means you trust that the script’s developer hasn’t inserted malicious functionality into the code and has secured it against attackers trying to do the same. You should never run code you don't trust.

Please read: [what I'm doing to ensure this is safe for users][security_policy].
